<b><i>devPhobe</i> (n):</b> A developer with a fear they might break something, often in production, if they make certain changes; frequently caused by a lack of automated testing services

<b><i>Agile Syndrome</i> (n)</b>: A developer condition, often characterized by one or more of the following traits:

* Follows the principles outlined in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
* Works in small iterative changes, rather than large unmergable code branches
* Exudes passion about automating builds, deployments, and rollbacks
* Writes and runs automated tests with every commit
* Writes infrastructure as code using industry standard tools like [Terraform](https://terraform.io) and [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)

<i>The devPhobe was afraid to merge his code to master, but once he came down with AgileSyndrome he realized his code could be tested fully in a protected environment, and the well outlined rollback strategy erased all anxiety.</i>

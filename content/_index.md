* Does your development team fear they might break something, often in production, when certain changes are made?
* Does your team lack automated testing frameworks?

Don't be a `devPhobe`. You don't need to be afraid of development, even in production. 

Would you rather be characterized as:
* A team that follows the principles outlined in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
* Working in small iterative changes, rather than large unmergable code branches
* Exuding passion about automating builds, deployments, and rollbacks
* Writing and running automated tests with every commit
* Using infrastructure as code using industry standard tools like [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/),  [Terraform](https://terraform.io) and [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)



The `devPhobe` was afraid to merge his code to master, but once he came down with AgileSyndrome he realized his code could write 
fully tested code from a protected environment, and deploy with a well outlined rollback strategy, erasing all anxiety.</i>

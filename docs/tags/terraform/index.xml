      <description>Terraform Like so many other people I jumped into Terraform right away. This was the answer I was looking for. It could provide an automated way to store AWS configurations in source control. It also let me try out Azure, Google, and many other providers in a cloud-agnostic (sorta) kinda of way.
Within a few days there were segments of code everywhere to create an EC2 instance. Everybody on my team made their own Terraform code.</description>

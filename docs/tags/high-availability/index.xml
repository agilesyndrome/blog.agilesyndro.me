      <description>Updated 2021-Dec-19 Yes, you should be in multiple-regions
I see this type of request in my office pretty often. A customer calls or writes in with a proposal that looks almost like this: &amp;ldquo;I have my servers running in us-east-1, all behind a load balancer. Can you assist us with a failover setup in the us-west-1 region?&amp;rdquo;
Yes, I most certainly can, but it probably isn&amp;rsquo;t what you want.
You run multiple EC2 instances, behind a load balancer or two.</description>

      <description>I recently looked back through my blog entries and came across an older article. &amp;ldquo;Do you really need redundancy in us-west-1&amp;rdquo;. For context, as I&amp;rsquo;m writing this article, we&amp;rsquo;re about a week after AWS experienced a short outage in both us-west-1 AND us-west-2 at the same time. We&amp;rsquo;re also a few weeks after a multi-hour outage of us-east-1.
Let me be clear. I was wrong. If I led you astray, and your site suffered due to recent outages, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry.</description>
